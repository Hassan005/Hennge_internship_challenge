Mission 1: Write a program which fulfills the requirements below
Description
We want you to calculate the sum of squares of given integers, excluding any negatives.
The first line of the input will be an integer N (1 <= N <= 100), indicating the number of test cases to follow.
Each of the test cases will consist of a line with an integer X (0 < X <= 100), followed by another line consisting of X number of space-separated integers Yn (-100 <= Yn <= 100).
For each test case, calculate the sum of squares of the integers, excluding any negatives, and print the calculated sum in the output.
Note: There should be no output until all the input has been received.
Note 2: Do not put blank lines between test cases solutions.
Note 3: Take input from standard input, and output to standard output.
Rules
Write your solution using Go Programming Language
Your source code must be a single file (package main)
Do not use any for and goto statement
You may only use standard library packages
Extra point is awarded if solution does not declare any global variables
